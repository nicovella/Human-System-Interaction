# Project Repository: Human-System Interaction (HSI) Studies

This repository contains two primary HSI (Human-System Interaction) research projects conducted for the **BSc in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Milano-Bicocca** (Academic Year 2025-2026). The research focuses on applying human-centered design principles to both AI conversational agents and mobile transportation interfaces.

## Project 1: Evaluation Scale for AI Study-Support Agents

**Goal:** Designing a rigorous framework to assess the interaction quality of LLMs acting as academic mentors.

### Overview

This project utilizes the **Hound Protocol**, assigning AI the role of a "Mentor" rather than a simple tool. The methodology establishes a human baseline through a SWOT analysis, which is then refined via collaborative iteration with various LLMs.

### Key Features

* 
**Human-First Methodology:** Establishing internal reasoning before AI intervention.


* 
**Comparative Analysis:** Detailed interaction testing with **Gemini 3 Pro** and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**.


* 
**Integrated Evaluation Scale:** A 7-point Likert scale measuring three core dimensions:


* 
**Capacity:** Technical effectiveness and fluency.


* 
**Alignment:** Trust, transparency, and ethical adherence.


* 
**Pedagogical Outcome:** The system's ability to scaffold learning and stimulate critical thinking.




* 
**UX Insights:** Analysis of the "Gulf of Execution" in Microsoft Copilot and the limitations of Phind 3's "mini-app" approach.

## Project 2: Enhancing the Commuter Experience (Trenord App)

**Goal:** An HSI study aimed at transitioning a mobile application from a passive data reporter to a proactive travel assistant.

### Overview

Focused on daily commuters, students, and workers, this study identifies friction points in retrieving real-time information during transit disruptions.

### Key Components

* 
**Human Factors Analysis:** Measuring cognitive workload, mental/temporal demand, and user frustration.


* 
**Evaluation Toolkit:** * **NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX):** To quantify mental demand.


* 
**Eye-Tracking:** Analyzing dwell times and visual search efficiency.


* 
**PANAS:** Assessing emotional affect and anxiety levels.




* **Proposed Solutions:**
* 
**Automated Re-routing:** Using GPS to offload cognitive burden by suggesting the top 3 alternative itineraries.


* 
**"Calm Mode" UI:** Implementing solution-oriented language to reduce user panic.


* 
**Smart Action CTAs:** High-contrast buttons for immediate route recovery.




## Tools & Technologies

* 
**LLMs:** Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Phind.


* 
**Methodologies:** SWOT Analysis, Hound Protocol, FBS Framework, ISO 9241-11 Usability Standards.


* 
**Evaluation Models:** NASA-TLX, PANAS, Eye-Tracking Heatmaps.
